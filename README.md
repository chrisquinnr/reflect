# Reflect

A sever-side Meteor project which repsonds to all HTTP requests by sending back whatever GET requests or POST body you've submitted.

Useful for debugging http ops in other projects, so as you can see exactly what you're sending out of your application.

It's simple to add mock HTTP responses if you want to, for more information see http://iron-meteor.github.io/iron-router/#creating-routes.
